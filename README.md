# NotableToObsidian - WIP
## Description 
A python script to move your Notable notes to a Obsidian Vault while modifying the syntax for tags, note links, etc. 

*This is a work in progress, some additional functionality is to come.*

## Usage

2) enter command: 
```shell
python3 notabletoobsidian.py <path to notable notes directory> <path to obisidian vault>
