# NotableToObsidian - WIP
## Description 
A python script to convert and move your Notable notes to a Obsidian Vault. This changes the syntax of tags, links, and attachments
to comply with Obsidian. 

*This is a work in progress, some additional functionality is to come.*

## Usage 
1) Download the `notabletoobsidian.py` script. 
2) enter command: 
```shell
python3 notabletoobsidian.py <path to notable notes directory> <path to obisidian vault> 
```
Note: 
  *At this moment in time, you will need to manually move your Attachements folder to your Obsidian vault and adjust Obsidian's setting for your Attachment's locations.*
  
## Issues
If you come accross any errors or problems running the script please create an issue. Thank you.
